# IONeq

IONeq is an X-ray high-resolution photoabsorption model which compute the absorption coefficient assuming ionization equilibrium. The model takes into account turbulent broadening.  A complete description of the science behind the model is described in [Gatuzz & Churazov (2018)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.474..696G/abstract).

OBTAINING IONeq

Different flavours of the model can be downloaded from the Github repository at https://github.com/efraingatuzz/IONeq. Currently versions include:

- IONeqther: A version of the model that computes optical depths assuming collisional ionization equilibrium conditions and solar abundances.
- IONeqthervar: Same as "IONthervar" but the elemental abundances are parameters of the model
- ioneqdev: latest develop version of the model.
